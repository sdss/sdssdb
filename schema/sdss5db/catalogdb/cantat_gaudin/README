The table catalogdb.cantat_gaudin_nodup has
primary key pkey and 5 columns from nodup.dat: 
radeg, dedeg, gaiadr2, proba, cluster.

For loading catalogdb.cantat_gaudin_nodup:
I used nodup.dat as the source of the data for converting to CSV
(nodup.dat has blank spaces for some fields in the middle and
at the end of a line.
The program cantat_gaudin_nodup_dat2csv.py takes this into account 
while translating from nodup.dat to nodup.csv.)

For loading catalogdb.cantat_gaudin_table1:
I used table1.dat as the source of the data for converting to CSV.
(table1.dat uses --- for NULL.
The program cantat_gaudin_table1_load.sql takes this into account while
loading the table1.csv file.)
