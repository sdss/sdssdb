For loading catalogdb.cantat_gaudin_nodup:
I used nodup.fits as the source of the data for converting to CSV
instead of nodup.dat because nodup.dat has blank spaces for some fields.

For loading catalogdb.cantat_gaudin_table1:
I used table1.dat as the source of the data for converting to CSV.
(table1.dat uses --- for NULL)
